# demo2020

## Background

Every ten years it is mandated by the U.S. Constitution that the United States is to count its population. The data collected is used to distribute federal funds to the states and make other decisions dependent on population. 

Beginning this year there will be three methods for citizens to particpate in the census including online, by phone, and by mail. See https://2020census.gov/en/about-questions.html for more info about the 2020 Census and the data that will be collected.

## Methodologies

1. Create a user-centered front end experience.
1. Design a language agnostic, test-driven application built for scale.
